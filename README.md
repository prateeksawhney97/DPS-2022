# DPS-2022

## AI Mission For the DPS Program

The code, plots, JSON endpoints and heroku webapp linked to this repository provides a method to visualise and predict historically the number of accidents per category and to forecast the values for the future. The method is applied to a data set which contains the monthly values for traffic accidents in Munich until the end of 2020. Forecasting from the Heroku Web Application can be done for each 3 distinct Accident Category i.e. Alcohol, Traffic and Escape.

The Link Of The Heroku Web Application is -> https://accidentdps.herokuapp.com/

Home Page which shows 3 sections for the user to navigate & predict the forecast of accidents for 2021 for each of the 3 categories:

For example, for the alcohol accidents, the user can enter the month number between 1 and 12 and can click on predict:

The Result i.e. the number of accidents for the specific category can be seen on the result page & the user can now navigate back to the Home Page for more Predictions:

The data set "Monatszahlen VerkehrsunfÃ¤lle" which can be downloaded from the below link and contains the following topics:
(https://www.opengov-muenchen.de/dataset/monatszahlen-verkehrsunfaelle/resource/40094bd6-f82d-4979-949b-26c8dc00b9a7)

1. Traffic accidents
2. Escape accidents
3. Alcohol accidents

The Models which are used by the web application are developed using Meta's Prophet ML Model (https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api). 
There are 3 distinct models whose source code and development can be found in the "AccidentPrediction.ipynb". I have also included all the 3 forecast models in the repository.

1. Traffic accidents -> forecast_model_traffic.bin
2. Escape accidents -> forecast_model_escape.bin
3. Alcohol accidents -> forecast_model.bin

## End Points that returns the Predictions in JSON Format :

I created 3 endpoints that returns the predictions in JSON format for Alcohol accidents, Traffic accidents and Escape accidents.

#### Note : These endpoints supports 2021, 2022 also. One can see the forecasts for Year 2022 also!

#### Another Approach:

I also trained my deep neural network by altering and figuring out which network works best for my input dataset. Used the 5 important columns and tried to fit the model using Keras but the results were not fruitful because of the less number of data. Another approach, I used was use all the columns of the input dataset (including not necessary columns too) and fitting my model onto that. The results were not upto the mark. 

Both of these implementation techniques could be found in the jupyter notebook "AccidentPrediction.ipynb". I have also included the ML model built using Keras in the ".h5" file format.
